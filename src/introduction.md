# Introduction

## We learn by doing

## Why Racket, of all things?

## Where are we headed?

- Basic data types
- Creating packages of data
- Functions

At this point we're effectively done – we've covered everything we need to write any program that you could want to write. But modern builders don't start construction projects by going to the woods and cutting down trees, they purchase milled lumber and pre-constructed components. They also subcontract out specialized tasks to professionals like electricians and plumbers. In the same way, professional software developers use a variety of tools and libraries in order to build programs faster and more reliably.

Choosing and using appropriate tools is one of the most important problem solving tasks in computer science (and most any field, really). We'll illustrate that here as well, using a variety of nifty Racket tools that greatly simplify the creation of graphical, interactive programs. By the end, we'll be able to make cool art, write simple games, and create simulations of powerful processes.

But first, we'd best start at the beginning, and learn how to do some simple arithmetic.
